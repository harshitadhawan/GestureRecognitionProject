dataset: https://bit.ly/4azSZOB
After downloading all files in the same folder and extracting the dataset open the "Action Detection Refined.py" file and run all the codes above the data collection ones.
Skip the data collection part if you are using the pre-trained model and the givendataset and if not then collect datapoints and adjust the "setting up folders" portion accordingly.
Load the model and import all the the other code files. Once done with this the final code for making predictions is ready to run.
